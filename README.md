# Coffee Shop Challenge

## Project Overview

This project simulates a coffee shop environment with three core models: `Customer`, `Coffee`, and `Order`. The project implements basic object-oriented design principles and allows for managing customers, orders, and coffee products. It includes key functionality such as:

- Customer ordering coffee.
- Tracking orders and prices.
- Aggregating and querying data for each customer and coffee.

  - `.create_order(coffee, price)`: Creates a new order for the customer.
